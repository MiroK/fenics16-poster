This is a  poster for FEniCS'16 workshop. The design is heavily inspired by Simun Funke's [dolfin-adjoin poster] 
(https://bitbucket.org/simon_funke/dolfin-adjoint-poster). If the choice of colors seems familiar it might because
they are the colors of a rather famous [PDE book](https://books.google.no/books?id=Xnu0o_EJrCQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Partial+Differential+Equations&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiZ-LSr8czMAhUBOpoKHY6IAXgQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&q=Partial%20Differential%20Equations&f=false).
Though appropriate, I did not choose these colors because FEniCS solves PDES.
Rather, the book really stands out from the crowd on my shelf :).
